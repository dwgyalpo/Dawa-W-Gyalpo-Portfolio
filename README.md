# Introduction
Hello! I am Dawa Wangchuk Gyalpo. Currently, pursuing my masters degree in Statistics at The University of Texas at El Paso. This is my portfolio page for my data visualization class. After the class, I will maintain this page for my future visualization. I am interested in data visualization, machine learning and deep learning.
